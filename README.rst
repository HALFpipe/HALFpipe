``HALFpipe`` is a user-friendly software that facilitates reproducible
analysis of fMRI data, including preprocessing, single-subject, and
group analysis. It provides state-of-the-art preprocessing using
`fmriprep <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/>`__, but removes the
necessity to convert data to the `BIDS
<https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ format. Common
resting-state and task-based fMRI features can then be calculated on the
fly.

`HALFpipe` relies on tools from well-established neuroimaging software
packages, either directly or through our dependencies, including `ANTs
<https://antspy.readthedocs.io/>`__, `FreeSurfer
<https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`__,  `FSL <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/>`__
and `nipype <https://nipype.readthedocs.io/>`__. We strongly urge users to
acknowledge these tools when publishing results obtained with HALFpipe.

*****************
 Getting started
*****************

``HALFpipe`` is distributed as a container, meaning that all required
software comes bundled in a monolithic file, the container. This allows
for easy installation on new systems, and makes data analysis more
reproducible, because software versions are guaranteed to be the same
for all users.

Container platform
==================

The first step is to install one of the supported container platforms.
If you’re using a high-performance computing cluster, more often than
not `Singularity <https://sylabs.io>`__ will already be available.

If not, we recommend using the latest version of\ `Singularity
<https://sylabs.io>`__. However, it can be somewhat cumbersome to
install, as it needs to be built from source.

The `NeuroDebian <https://neuro.debian.net/>`__ package repository
provides an older version of `Singularity
<https://sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/>`__ for `some
<https://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/singularity-container.html>`__ Linux
distributions.

If you are running ``mac OS``, then you should be able to run the
container with ``Docker Desktop``.

If you are running Windows, you can also try running with ``Docker
Desktop``, but we have not done any compatibility testing yet, so issues
may occur, for example with respect to file systems.

      -  Version
      -  Installation

   -  -  Singularity

   -  -  Singularity
      -  2.x
      -  ``sudo apt install singularity-container``

   -  -  Docker
      -  ..
      -  See https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Download
========

The second step is to download the ``HALFpipe`` to your computer. This
requires approximately 5 gigabytes of storage.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   -  -  Container platform
      -  Version
      -  Installation

   -  -  Singularity
      -  3.x
      -  https://download.fmri.science/singularity/halfpipe-latest.sif

   -  -  Singularity
      -  2.x
      -  https://download.fmri.science/singularity/halfpipe-latest.simg

   -  -  Docker
      -  ..
      -  ``docker pull halfpipe/halfpipe:latest``

``Singularity`` version ``3.x`` creates a container image file called
``HALFpipe_{version}.sif`` in the directory where you run the ``pull``
command. For ``Singularity`` version ``2.x`` the file is named
``halfpipe-halfpipe-master-latest.simg``. Whenever you want to use the
container, you need pass ``Singularity`` the path to this file.

   **NOTE:** ``Singularity`` may store a copy of the container in its
   cache directory. The cache directory is located by default in your
   home directory at ``~/.singularity``. If you need to save disk space
   in your home directory, you can safely delete the cache directory
   after downloading, i.e. by running ``rm -rf ~/.singularity``.
   Alternatively, you could move the cache directory somewhere with more
   free disk space using a symlink. This way, files will automatically
   be stored there in the future. For example, if you have a lot of free
   disk space in ``/mnt/storage``, then you could first run ``mv
   ~/.singularity /mnt/storage`` to move the cache directory, and then
   ``ln -s /mnt/storage/.singularity ~/.singularity`` to create the
   symlink.

``Docker`` will store the container in its storage base directory, so it
does not matter from which directory you run the ``pull`` command.

Running
=======

The third step is to run the downloaded container. You may need to
replace ``halfpipe-halfpipe-latest.simg`` with the actual path and
filename where ``Singularity`` downloaded your container.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   -  -  Container platform
      -  Command

   -  -  Singularity
      -  ``singularity run --containall --bind /:/ext
         halfpipe-halfpipe-latest.simg``

   -  -  Docker
      -  ``docker run --interactive --tty --volume /:/ext
         halfpipe/halfpipe``

You should now see the user interface.

Background
----------

Containers are by default isolated from the host computer. This adds
security, but also means that the container cannot access the data it
needs for analysis. ``HALFpipe`` expects all inputs (e.g., image files
and spreadsheets) and outputs (the working directory) to be places in
the path\ ``/ext`` (see also ```--fs-root``
<#data-file-system-root---fs-root>`__). Using the option ``--bind
/:/ext``, we instruct ``Singularity`` to map all of the host file system
(``/``) to that path (``/ext``). You can also run ``HALFpipe`` and only
map only part of the host file system, but keep in mind that any
directories that are not mapped will not be visible later.

``Singularity`` passes the host shell environment to the container by
default. This means that in some cases, the host computer’s
configuration can interfere with the software. To avoid this, we need to
pass the option ``--containall``. ``Docker`` does not pass the host
shell environment by default, so we don’t need to pass an option.

****************
 User interface
****************

   Outdated

The user interface asks a series of questions about your data and the
analyses you want to run. In each question, you can press ``Control+C``
to cancel the current question and go back to the previous one.
``Control+D`` exits the program without saving. Note that these keyboard
shortcuts are the same on Mac.

Files
=====

To run preprocessing, at least a T1-weighted structural image and a BOLD
image file is required. Preprocessing and data analysis proceeds
automatically. However, to be able to run automatically, data files need
to be input in a way suitable for automation.

For this kind of automation, ``HALFpipe`` needs to know the
relationships between files, such as which files belong to the same
subject. However, even though it would be obvious for a human, a program
cannot easily assign a file name to a subject, and this will be true as
long as there are differences in naming between different researchers or
labs. One researcher may name the same file ``subject_01_rest.nii.gz``
and another ``subject_01/scan_rest.nii.gz``.

In ``HALFpipe``, we solve this issue by inputting file names in a
specific way. For example, instead of ``subject_01/scan_rest.nii.gz``,
``HALFpipe`` expects you to input ``{subject}/scan_rest.nii.gz``.
``HALFpipe`` can then match all files on disk that match this naming
schema, and extract the subject ID ``subject_01``. Using the extracted
subject ID, other files can now be matched to this image. If all input
files are available in BIDS format, then this step can be skipped.

#. ``Specify working directory`` All intermediate and outputs of
   ``HALFpipe`` will be placed in the working directory. Keep in mind to
   choose a location with sufficient free disk space, as intermediates
   can be multiple gigabytes in size for each subject.

Features are analyses that are carried out on the preprocessed data, in
other words, first-level analyses.

               three arrays: ``names`` (condition), ``onsets`` and
               ``durations``

            -  ``FSL 3-column`` One text file for each condition. Each
               file has its corresponding condition in the filename. The
               first column specifies the event onset, the second the
               duration. The third column of the files is ignored, so
               parametric modulation is not supported

            -  ``BIDS TSV`` A tab-separated table with named columns
               ``trial_type`` (condition), ``onset`` and ``duration``.
               While BIDS supports defining additional columns,
               ``HALFpipe`` will currently ignore these

               matrix. In contrast, the temporal filtering of the input
               image and any confound regressors added to the design
               matrix is specified in 10. In general, the two settings
               should match

   TODO

*************************************************
 Running on a high-performance computing cluster
*************************************************

#. Log in to your cluster’s head node

#. Request an interactive job. Refer to your cluster’s documentation for
   how to do this

#. |  In the interactive job, run the ``HALFpipe`` user interface, but
      add the flag ``--use-cluster`` to the end of the command.
   |  For example, ``singularity run --containall --bind /:/ext
      halfpipe-halfpipe-latest.sif --use-cluster``

#. As soon as you finish specifying all your data, features and models
   in the user interface, ``HALFpipe`` will now generate everything
   needed to run on the cluster. For hundreds of subjects, this can take
   up to a few hours.

#. When ``HALFpipe`` exits, edit the generated submit script
   ``submit.slurm.sh`` according to your cluster’s documentation and
   then run it. This submit script will calculate everything except
   group statistics.

#. As soon as all processing has been completed, you can run group
   statistics. This is usually very fast, so you can do this in an
   interactive session. Run ``singularity run --containall --bind /:/ext
   halfpipe-halfpipe-latest.sif --only-model-chunk`` and then select
   ``Run without modification`` in the user interface.

..

   A common issue with remote work via secure shell is that the
   connection may break after a few hours. For batch jobs this is not an
   issue, but for interactive jobs this can be quite frustrating. When
   the connection is lost, the node you were connected to will
   automatically quit all programs you were running. To prevent this,
   you can run interactive jobs within ``screen`` or ``tmux`` (whichever
   is available). These commands allow you to open sessions in the
   terminal that will continue running in the background even when you
   close or disconnect. Here’s a quick overview of how to use the
   commands (more in-depth documentation is available for example at
   http://www.dayid.org/comp/tm.html).

   #. Open a new screen/tmux session on the head node by running either
      ``screen`` or ``tmux``

   #. Request an interactive job from within the session, for example
      with ``srun --pty bash -i``

   #. Run the command that you want to run

   #. Detach from the screen/tmux session, meaning disconnecting with
      the ability to re-connect later For screen, this is done by first
      pressing ``Control+a``, then letting go, and then pressing ``d``
      on the keyboard. For tmux, it’s ``Control+b`` instead of
      ``Control+a``. Note that this is always ``Control``, even if
      you’re on a mac.

   #. Close your connection to the head node with ``Control+d``.
      ``screen``/``tmux`` will remain running in the background

   #. Later, connect again to the head node. Run ``screen -r`` or ``tmux
      attach`` to check back on the interactive job. If everything went
      well and the command you wanted to run finished, close the
      interactive job with ``Control+d`` and then the
      ``screen``/``tmux`` session with ``Control+d`` again. If the
      command hasn’t finished yet, detach as before and come back later

..

    Are you getting a "missing dependencies" error? Some clusters configure singularity with an option called `mount hostfs <https://sylabs.io/guides/3.9/user-guide/bind_paths_and_mounts.html#disabling-system-binds>`_ that will bind all cluster file systems into the container. These file systems may in some cases have paths that conflict with where software is installed in the ``HALFpipe`` container, effectively overwriting that software. You can disable this by adding the option ``--no-mount hostfs`` right after ``singularity run``.

-  If an error occurs, this will be output to the command line and
   simultaneously to the ``err.txt`` file in the working directory

-  If the error occurs while running, usually a text file detailing the
   error will be placed in the working directory. These are text files
   and their file names start with ``crash``

   -  Usually, the last line of these text files contains the error
      message. Please read this carefully, as may allow you to
      understand the error

   -  For example, consider the following error message: ``ValueError:
      shape (64, 64, 33) for image 1 not compatible with first image
      shape (64, 64, 34) with axis == None`` This error message may seem
      cryptic at first. However, looking at the message more closely, it
      suggests that two input images have different, incompatible
      dimensions. In this case, ``HALFpipe`` correctly recognized this
      issue, and there is no need for concern. The images in question
      will simply be excluded from preprocessing and/or analysis

   -  In some cases, the cause of the error can be a bug in the
      ``HALFpipe`` code. Please check that no similar issue has been
      reported `here on GitHub
      <https://github.com/HALFpipe/HALFpipe/issues>`__. In this case,
      please submit an `issue
      <https://github.com/HALFpipe/HALFpipe/issues/new/choose>`__.

 Command line flags
********************

Control command line logging
============================

.. code:: bash

   --verbose

By default, only errors and warnings will be output to the command line.
This makes it easier to see when something goes wrong, because there is
less output. However, if you want to be able to inspect what is being
run, you can add the ``--verbose`` flag to the end of the command used
to call ``HALFpipe``.

Verbose logs are always written to the ``log.txt`` file in the working
directory, so going back and inspecting this log is always possible,
even if the ``--verbose`` flag was not specified.

Specifying the flag ``--debug`` will print additional, fine-grained
messages. It will also automatically start the `Python Debugger
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html>`__ when an error occurs.
You should only use ``--debug`` if you know what you’re doing.

Automatically remove unneeded files
===================================

.. code:: bash

   --keep

``HALFpipe`` saves intermediate files for each pipeline step. This
speeds up re-running with different settings, or resuming after a job
after it was cancelled. The intermediate file are saved by the `nipype
<https://nipype.readthedocs.io/>`__ workflow engine, which is what
``HALFpipe`` uses internally. ``nipype`` saves the intermediate files in
the ``nipype`` folder in the working directory.

In environments with limited disk capacity, this can be problematic. To
limit disk usage, ``HALFpipe`` can delete intermediate files as soon as
they are not needed anymore. This behavior is controlled with the
``--keep`` flag.

The default option ``--keep some`` keeps all intermediate files from
fMRIPrep and MELODIC, which would take the longest to re-run. We believe
this is a good tradeoff between disk space and computer time. ``--keep
all`` turns of all deletion of intermediate files. ``--keep none``
deletes as much as possible, meaning that the smallest amount possible
of disk space will be used.

Configure nipype
================

.. code:: bash

   --nipype-<omp-nthreads|memory-gb|n-procs|run-plugin>

``HALFpipe`` chooses sensible defaults for all of these values.

Choose which parts to run or to skip
====================================

   Outdated

.. code:: bash

   --<only|skip>-<spec-ui|workflow|run|model-chunk>

A ``HALFpipe`` run is divided internally into three stages, spec-ui,
workflow, and run.

#. The ``spec-ui`` stage is where you specify things in the user
   interface. It creates the ``spec.json`` file that contains all the
   information needed to run ``HALFpipe``. To only run this stage, use
   the option ``--only-spec-ui``. To skip this stage, use the option
   ``--skip-spec-ui``

#. The ``workflow`` stage is where ``HALFpipe`` uses the ``spec.json``
   data to search for all the files that match what was input in the
   user interface. It then generates a ``nipype`` workflow for
   preprocessing, feature extraction and group models. ``nipype`` then
   validates the workflow and prepares it for execution. This usually
   takes a couple of minutes and cannot be parallelized. For hundreds of
   subjects, this may even take a few hours. This stage has the
   corresponding option ``--only-workflow`` and ``--skip-workflow``.

-  This stage saves several intermediate files. These are named
   ``workflow.{uuid}.pickle.xz``, ``execgraph.{uuid}.pickle.xz`` and
   ``execgraph.{n_chunks}_chunks.{uuid}.pickle.xz``. The ``uuid`` in the
   file name is a unique identifier generated from the ``spec.json``
   file and the input files. It is re-calculated every time we run this
   stage. The uuid algorithm produces a different output if there are
   any changes (such as when new input files for new subjects become
   available, or the ``spec.json`` is changed, for example to add a new
   feature or group model). Otherwise, the ``uuid`` stays the same.
   Therefore, if a workflow file with the calculated ``uuid`` already
   exists, then we do not need to run this stage. We can simple reuse
   the workflow from the existing file, and save some time.

-  In this stage, we can also decide to split the execution into chunks.
   The flag ``--subject-chunks`` creates one chunk per subject. The flag
   ``--use-cluster`` automatically activates ``--subject-chunks``. The
   flag ``--n-chunks`` allows the user to specify a specific number of
   chunks. This is useful if the execution should be spread over a set
   number of computers. In addition to these, a model chunk is
   generated.

#. The ``run`` stage loads the
   ``execgraph.{n_chunks}_chunks.{uuid}.pickle.xz`` file generated in
   the previous step and runs it. This file usually contains two chunks,
   one for the subject level preprocessing and feature extraction
   (“subject level chunk”), and one for group statistics (“model
   chunk”). To run a specific chunk, you can use the flags
   ``--only-chunk-index ...`` and ``--only-model-chunk``.

Working directory
=================

.. code:: bash

   --workdir

..

   TODO

Data file system root
=====================

.. code:: bash

   --fs-root

The ``HALFpipe`` container, or really most containers, contain the
entire base system needed to run

********************
Run group-levels using command-line flag
********************

An alternative to setting up group-level analyses in the user interface is to use the ‘group-level’ command directly in the terminal or in a script. The benefit of this approach is that it does not require you to have specified group-level contrasts when setting up the first-level feature extraction. Currently, HALFpipe does not support running group-level analyses from first-level features using the user interface. Instead, if you have already extracted first-level features and attempt to add group-level models in the user interface, HALFpipe will re-run all first-level feature extraction again. Therefore, this command is a more efficient way to run group-level models, both on high-performance clusters and on single workstations. 

To use this command, run the HALFpipe container adding the flag  ``group-level`` to the end of the command. For example  ``singularity run --containall --bind /:/ext halfpipe-halfpipe-latest.sif group-level``

There are multiple flags that allow you to specify paths, filter and modify inputs, define the design, and specify other model information. Not all these flags must be specified, but those that are compulsory are indicated with an asterisk (*). In general, HALFpipe adopts an inclusive approach to running group-levels in this way, so that anything that is not explicitly omitted or excluded from the model will be run. 

Paths: define the input and output paths
=====================

.. code:: bash

   --input-directory PATH * 
   --working-directory PATH
   --workdir PATH
   --wd PATH

All mean the same and are interchangeable, point to one or more input directories containing the HALFpipe derivatives.


.. code:: bash

   --output-directory PATH *
   --outdir PATH

Both flags mean the same, point to the directory to write the results to.


Filter: arguments for filtering the inputs
=====================

There are several ways to filter the first-level features that are included in the group-level analyses, including on the basis of tags. Tags may be one of: ``feature``, ``setting``, ``seed``, ``map``, ``component``, ``atlas``, ``task``, ``taskcontrast``. 

.. code:: bash

    --include TAG VALUE  
    --include-list TAG PATH   

A tag and a value may be specified. Will include only images with this tag and value. If multiple are specified, images must match one of them. Examples may be ``--include task TOL`` or ``--include feature ICAAROMA``.
Alternatively, a tag and a path to a file may be specified. Will include only images with this tag and any of the values in the file.


.. code:: bash

    --exclude TAG VALUE
    --exclude-list TAG PATH

A tag and a value/path may be specified. Will exclude images with this tag and value, or any of the values in the file.


.. code:: bash

    --fd-mean-cutoff NUMBER
    --fd-perc-cutoff PERCENTAGE

Will exclude subjects with a mean framewise displacement and/or a percentage of high framewise displacement volumes above these cutoffs. The defaults are 0.5mm mean framewise displacement and 10% of frames above this threshhold.


.. code:: bash
    
    --missing-value-strategy listwise-deletion
 
Currently the only available option is ``listwise-deletion``. Will use this strategy to handle missing values in the covariates.


Modify: arguments for modifying the inputs
=====================

.. code:: bash

  --rename TAG FROM TO

If you are combining subjects across different samples for a group-level analysis, sometimes known as a mega-analysis, you may find that different samples have different naming of tasks, processing settings, task contrasts, etc. In this case, HALFpipe allows you to combine these different first-level features across subjects, but they must first have a uniform naming convention. Instead of changing the file names in the derivatives folder, HALFpipe makes use of this flag to temporarily modify inputs by changing all values of tag from the value ``FROM`` to the value ``TO``. For example ``--rename task TowerOfLondon TOL``. 

.. code:: bash

  --aggregate across [across ...]

Will aggregate the images across the given tags with a fixed effects model.


Design:  arguments for defining the design
=====================

.. code:: bash

  --from-spec PATH

The path to a working directory may be specified. Will load the model and filter from the working directory's ``spec.json`` file.

.. code:: bash

  --model-name NAME

The name of the model to use may be specified if running from a spec file. This flag may also be used to designate the name of the group-level model for the output.

.. code:: bash

  --qc-exclude-files PATH

The path to one or more ``exclude.json`` files generated by the quality check web interface may be specified.

.. code:: bash

  --spreadsheet PATH
                        
The path to the spreadsheet containing model covariates may be specified. Requires specifying ``--id-column``.

.. code:: bash

  --id-column VARIABLE

The name of the column containing the subject IDs must be specified.

.. code:: bash

  --categorical-variable VARIABLE

The name of the variable to be added to the model as a categorical variable may be specified. Requires specifying ``--levels``.

.. code:: bash

  --levels LEVELS

The levels of the categorical variable must be specified. For example ``--levels M F``. 

.. code:: bash

  --continuous-variable VARIABLE

The name of the variable to be added to the model as a continuous variable may be specified.


Derived: arguments for adding variables and images derived from the data
=====================

.. code:: bash

  --imaging-variable VARIABLE

One of the following may be specified: ``fd_mean``, ``fd_perc``, ``mean_gm_tsnr``, ``aroma_noise_frac``, ``total_intracranial_volume``, ``jacobian_mean`` ,``jacobian_variance``. Will add this variable to the model as a continuous variable.

.. code:: bash

  --derived-variable VARIABLE

A variable name and formula may be specified. Will add this variable to the model as a variable derived from existing variables via the specified formula. For example ``--derived-variable …``.

.. code:: bash

  --derived-image jacobian
 
Currently the only available option is ``jacobian``. Will calculate this image from the data and add it to the model.

.. code:: bash

  --drop-variable VARIABLE

A variable name may be specified. Will remove the variable from the covariates.


Stats:   arguments for defining the statistics to run
=====================

.. code:: bash

  --algorithm ALGORITHM *

One of the following must be specified: ``descriptive``, ``flame1``, ``heterogeneity``, ``mcartest``. Will run the algorithms to run for the analysis.


Export: arguments for exporting variables
=====================

.. code:: bash

  --export-variable VARIABLE

A variable name may be specified. Will export the variable with this name as a phenotype.

.. code:: bash

  --export-modes NAME IMAGE_PATH LABEL_PATH
                      
A mode name, image path, and label path may be specified. For all images, will export the modes defined by the image/label files.

.. code:: bash

  --export-atlas NAME TYPE IMAGE_PATH LABEL_PATH
                        
An atlas name, type, image path, and label path may be specified. For all images, will export region signals based on the atlas defined by the image/label files.

.. code:: bash

  --minimum-atlas-coverage MINIMUM_ATLAS_COVERAGE

A number may be specified that determines the minimum proportion of voxels in each atlas region that must be covered by the subject-specific mask for region to be included in the analysis.
